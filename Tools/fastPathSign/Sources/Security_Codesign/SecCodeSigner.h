/*!
	The following CFString constants can be used as keys in the parameters argument
	of SecCodeSignerCreate to specify various modes and options of the signing operation.
	Passing any keys not specified here may lead to undefined behavior and is not supported.
	The same applies to passing objects of types not explicitly allowed here.

	@constant kSecCodeSignerDetached Determines where the signature is written.
		If this key is absent, the code being signed is modified to contain the signature,
		replacing any signature already embedded there.
		If the value is kCFNull, the signature is written to the system-wide detached
		signature database. (You must have root privileges to write there.)
		If the value of this key is a CFURL, the signature is written to a file at that location,
		replacing any data there.
		If the value is a CFMutableData, the signature is appended to that data.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerDryRun A boolean value. If present and true, the actual writing
		of the signature is inhibited, and the code is not modified, but all operations
		leading up to this are performed normally, including the cryptographic access to
		the signing identity (if any).
	@constant kSecCodeSignerFlags A CFNumber specifying which flags to set in the code signature.
		Note that depending on circumstances, this value may be augmented or modified
		as part of the signing operation.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerIdentifier If present, a CFString that explicitly specifies
		the unique identifier string sealed into the code signature. If absent, the identifier
		is derived implicitly from the code being signed.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerIdentifierPrefix If the unique identifier string of the code signature
		is implicitly generated, and the resulting string does not contain any "." (dot)
		characters, then the (string) value of this parameter is prepended to the identifier.
		By convention, the prefix is usually of the form "com.yourcompany.", but any value
		is acceptable. If the kSecCodeSignerIdentifier parameter is specified, this parameter
		is ineffective (but still allowed).
	@constant kSecCodeSignerIdentity A SecIdentityRef describing the signing identity
		to use for signing code. This is a mandatory parameter for signing operations.
		Its value must be either a SecIdentityRef specifying a cryptographic identity
		valid for Code Signing, or the special value kCFNull to indicate ad-hoc signing.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerOperation The type of operation to be performed. Valid values
		are kSecCodeSignerOperationSign to sign code, and kSecCodeSignerOperationRemove
		to remove any existing signature from code. The default operation is to sign code.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerPageSize An integer value explicitly specifying the page size
		used to sign the main executable. This must be a power of two. A value of zero indicates
		infinite size (no paging).
		Only certain page sizes are allowed in most circumstances, and specifying an inappropriate
		size will lead to spurious verification failures. This is for expert use only.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerRequirements Specifies the internal requirements to be sealed into
		the code signature. Must be either a CFData containing the binary (compiled) form of
		a requirements set (SuperBlob), or a CFString containing a valid text form to be
		compiled into binary form. Default requirements are automatically generated if this
		parameter is omitted, and defaults may be applied to particular requirement types
		that are not specified; but any requirement type you specify is sealed exactly as
		specified.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerResourceRules A CFDictionary containing resource scanning rules
		determining what resource files are sealed into the signature (and in what way).
		A situation-dependent default is applied if this parameter is not specified.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerSDKRoot A CFURLRef indicating an alterate directory root
		where signing operations should find subcomponents (libraries, frameworks, modules, etc.).
		The default is the host system root "/".
	@constant kSecCodeSignerSigningTime Specifies what date and time is sealed into the
		code signature's CMS data. Can be either a CFDate object specifying a date, or
		the value kCFNull indicating that no date should be included in the signature.
		If not specified, the current date is chosen and sealed.
		Since an ad-hoc signature has no CMS data, this argument is ineffective
		for ad-hoc signing operations.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerRequireTimestamp A CFBoolean indicating (if kCFBooleanTrue) that
		the code signature should be certified by a timestamp authority service. This option
		requires access to a timestamp server (usually over the Internet). If requested and
		the timestamp server cannot be contacted or refuses service, the signing operation fails.
		The timestamp value is not under the caller's control.
		If the value is kCFBooleanFalse, no timestamp service is contacted and the resulting signature
		has no certified timestamp.
		If this key is omitted, a default is used that may vary from release to release.
		Note that when signing multi-architectural ("fat") programs, each architecture will
		be signed separately, and thus each architecture will have a slightly different timestamp.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerTimestampServer A CFURL specifying which timestamp authority service
		to contact for timestamping if requested by the kSecCodeSignerRequireTimestamp argument.
		If omitted (and timestamping is performed), a system-defined default value is used, referring
		to an Apple-operated timestamp service. Note that this service may not freely serve all requests.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerTimestampAuthentication A SecIdentityRef describing the identity
        used to authenticate to the timestamp authority server, if the server requires client-side
		(SSL/TLS) authentication. This will not generally be the identity used to sign the actual
		code, depending on the requirements of the timestamp authority service used.
		If omitted, the timestamp server is contacted using unauthenticated HTTP requests.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerTimestampOmitCertificates A CFBoolean indicating (if kCFBooleanTrue)
		that the timestamp embedded in the signature, if requested, not contain the full certificate chain
		of the timestamp service used. This will make for a marginally smaller signature, but may not
		verify correctly unless all such certificates are available (through the keychain system)
		on the verifying system.
		The default is to embed enough certificates to ensure proper verification of Apple-generated
		timestamp signatures.
	@constant kSecCodeSignerRuntimeVersion A CFString indicating the version of runtime hardening policies
		that the process should be opted into. The string should be of the form "x", "x.x", or "x.x.x" where
		x is a number between 0 and 255. This parameter is optional. If the signer specifies
		kSecCodeSignatureRuntime but does not provide this parameter, the runtime version will be the SDK
		version built into the Mach-O.
